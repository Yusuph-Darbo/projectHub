# Task Management System

A full-stack task management system designed to help teams organise, track,
and collaborate on work in real time. The application allows users to create
projects, manage tasks, and receive live updates when task changes occur.

The system is built using a modern full-stack architecture with a RESTful
backend and a reactive frontend. It focuses on clean backend design,
secure authentication, and real-time collaboration.
